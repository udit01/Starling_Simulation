behavior of birs with wind direction
show interaction with less starlings
add border before adding new starlings

mmatch ke with net
seaparation effects - visible --r
slider
internal presssure > external pressure -- r
difference between separation and cohesion radius
observe and tell
help section change order
Seperation    -- use sliders / (rotating / linear)
Cohesion    -- use sliders (rotating / linear)
Alignment    -- use sliders (rotating / linear)

Energy is very high ? Then itâ€™s not possible and something else .
Does your simulation reflect reality ?
How does it reflect reality ?
